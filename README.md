# Blueprint

Blueprint is a Game Framework made in [Haxe](https://haxe.org) that compiles to native platforms using hxcpp.
Blueprint is powered by a wide range of native libraries such as [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/),
[OpenAL (soft)](https://openal-soft.org/), and [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

## Getting started

To get started with the framework, install the library with one simple command:

```sh
haxelib git blueprint https://github.com/BlueprintFramework-Team/Blueprint
```

Then look through one of the [demos](https://github.com/BlueprintFramework-Team/Blueprint-Demos) to get a basic understanding on how to use the library
(sorry that there are currently no tutorials!)
