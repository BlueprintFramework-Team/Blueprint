NOTE: AS OF RIGHT NOW, THERE IS NOTHING EXCEPT BINDINGS HERE.

PLEASE BE PATIENT WHILE THIS IS DEVELOPED.

until then, enjoy the bindings and this minimal readme file!

# Blueprint - Work in progress

This is a [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) framework made using custom bindings for [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)!

Please note: I am extremely dumb so if there's any issues, please make an issue or even better, make a pull request!

Special Thanks:

- [Leather128](https://github.com/Leather128) - Helped a lot with my dumb self failing c bindings and helped with rendering issues. (Theres a testing source for this framework.)
